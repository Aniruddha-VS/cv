<!-- CGI ->

Landing a job at CGI as Software Engineer, while having Civil Engineering as a major, during the ongoing 2021 economicaly uncertain period was a blessing.

Had the oportunity to learn about DevOps methodology and got hands on experience with IBM UrbanCode Deploy, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and later with opensource monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

Recieved recogniton for spearheading resource optimization efforts across multiple projects resulting in a total of 40 % cpu optimization respectively.

Hoping to continue leraning as much as I can along this journey.


VNIT ->

VNIT gave me the opportunity to meet inspiring people, explore several disciplines and offcourse got me back with my hobby of swimming. Spending 4 years on campus has definitely reshaped my world view for good.

Doing a research internship at campus with focus on my major Civil Enginering over the summer learning about lateral earth pressure theories with my project partner under amzing professor made me realize importance of persistance self learining.

Breaking out of my comfortzone and socializing with team mates while winning 2 bronze for my college in internit swimming competitions overy two terms, gave me sense of teamspirit and meaning which was definitely the best experience throught my college journey.
